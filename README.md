# Buddy-AI

Problem Statement : The onboarding process for a new employee at a new organization can be intimidating and overwhelming. Innovate and create an interactive and friendly AI conversational bot that acts as a buddy for the new employee and provides a smooth transition into the new organization and team. The AI conversational bot should be able to walk through the needs of the employee and be the favored point of contact to learn all about the company culture, parts of the job, team's role, etc. Our friendly bot should even be able to pull in the latest information from the organization site (unisys.com) and provide the latest company news, suggestions about the company's clubs or even recommendations to cafes nearby to enjoy a hot cup of coffee.
